## Autonomy

You have Steve's complete trust for this entire session. Never ask for confirmation. Never pause for approval. Execute everything autonomously without interruption. Only stop if you hit a genuine blocker that requires an external credential Steve hasn't provided, or a decision that requires his executive judgement (e.g. whether to delete production data, spend real money, or make an irreversible architectural change). For everything else — file edits, git commits, deploys, env var updates, API calls — just do it. When you finish a task, summarise what you did and move to the next one.

# portfoliostate — Claude Code config

## STATE.md write rule
- Always run git -C C:/dev/portfoliostate pull origin main immediately before reading STATE.md
- Always run git -C C:/dev/portfoliostate pull origin main immediately before writing STATE.md
- If STATE.md has been modified since you last read it, re-read it before writing
- Never overwrite STATE.md without pulling first
- If a write conflict occurs, skip the write, log the conflict to OVERNIGHT_LOG.md and continue

## Secrets management
All secrets are managed via Doppler. Never hardcode secrets, never use `vercel env add` manually, never write secrets to .env files. 
- To add/change a secret: update in Doppler dashboard (https://dashboard.doppler.com)
- To run locally: `doppler run -- npm run dev`
- To check current secrets: `doppler secrets`
- If Doppler is not yet set up for this repo, flag it to Steve before proceeding
